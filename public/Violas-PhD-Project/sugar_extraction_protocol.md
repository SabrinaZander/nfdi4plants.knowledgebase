# Sugar/Starch Extraction

* Grind samples in liquid nitrogen and weigh out 20 to a maximum of 100 mg. (Note the weighed amount?!)
* Add 500µl of water to, for example, 50 mg of sample and place it directly in a thermoblock at 95°C for 15 minutes. After 10 minutes, vortex each sample for 3-4 seconds. [Place samples in the thermoblock at regular intervals to ensure all samples are treated equally and remain in the thermoblock for 15 minutes.]
* After 15 minutes, vortex the samples well and let them cool to room temperature (RT).
* Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 20,000g, 40°C.
* Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and store at -20°C for sugar measurement (samples for sugar measurement are now ready).
* Add 500µl of ethanol (80% abs.) to the pellet and resuspend.
* Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 20,000g, 4°C.
* Discard the supernatant.
* Add 500µl of ethanol (80% abs.) to the pellet and resuspend.
* Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 20,000g, 4°C.
* Discard the supernatant.
* Add 500µl of autoclaved water to the pellet and resuspend.
* Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 20,000g, 4°C.
* Discard the supernatant.
* Depending on the initial weighed amount, add 250µl of freshly prepared sodium acetate (50mmol, pH 4.7).
* Autoclave for 20 minutes, liquid program (Program 8).

Set up starch digestion overnight with shaking at 37°C:
For 100 samples: 100 x 250µl NaAc (50 mM) = 25ml total volume.
25mg α-Amylase (SIGMA; 9000-90-2) [final concentration: 1mg/ml], or 5 units per sample.
1125µl Amyloglucosidase (ROCHE from Asp. Niger; 10102857001) [final concentration: 45µl/ml], or 5 units per sample.

## The next day

- Place all samples in a thermoblock for 10 minutes at 95°C to inactivate the enzymes.
- Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 20,000g (For the calculation, add the volume of x µl added before autoclaving and the 250 µl enzyme mix).

### Premix for Sugar/Starch Measurement (100 samples)

- 10ml water
- 6ml HEPES (stock: 333mM, pH 7.5, autoclaved)
- 1ml MgCl2 (stock: 200mM, sterile filtered)
- 1ml ATP (stock: 40 mM, aliquoted and stored at -20°C)
- 1ml NADP (stock: 16mM, aliquoted and stored at -20°C)
- 10µl Glu-6-P-DH (from Leuconstock)

### For each sample measurement

* Pipette 190µl premix and 10µl sample into a well (96-well plate).
Program: Desktop > Olli-Starch: Start. The program runs 5 cycles [blank later].
* The program will automatically eject the plate to add hexokinase/PGI/invertase (from the refrigerator: diluted 1:10 in HEPES; add 1µl using a stamping plate).
* Insert the plate.
* The measurement resumes: When the values begin to stabilize, the measurement can be stopped.
