# Study Name: Growth Protocol for *Arabidopsis thaliana*

## Parameters:
- 200 µmol photons m²/s (200 Einstein)
- Alternating 6°C (cold treatment) and 25°C (control)
- 4 days

## Characteristics:
- *Arabidopsis thaliana*
- Leaf
- Hydroponic culture
- Columbia (Col-0)

### Protocol Overview:
1. **Preparation of Hydroponic System**:
   - Prepare nutrient solution suitable for *Arabidopsis* growth.
   - Set up hydroponic culture system with proper aeration and nutrient circulation.

2. **Seed Germination and Transfer**:
   - Germinate *Arabidopsis thaliana* seeds (Columbia ecotype) in nutrient agar plates.
   - After 7-10 days of germination, transfer seedlings into hydroponic culture trays.

3. **Growth Conditions**:
   - For cold stress treatment, expose plants to 6°C under continuous light at 200 µmol photons m²/s for the 4-day growing period.
   - For control plants, maintain at 25°C under the same light intensity for the same duration.

4. **Monitoring and Sampling**:
   - Monitor leaf development and sample at regular intervals to assess the impact of cold temperature on leaf physiology and growth.

5. **End of Experiment**:
   - After 4 days, collect leaf samples for further analysis of physiological and molecular responses.

This protocol ensures that temperature and light conditions are strictly controlled to study the cold response in *Arabidopsis thaliana*.
