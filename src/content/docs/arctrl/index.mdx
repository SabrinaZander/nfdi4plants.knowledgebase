`ARCtrl` is a software library to work with Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs). 
It contains an in-memory representation of an ARC and loads of functions to 
- manipulate and build both the ARC and its subcomponents
- read and write different representations, including the ARC Scaffold and ARC-RO-Crate

:::tip
If you're not sure about the ARC concept, check out [arc-rdm.org](https://arc-rdm.org/details/organization-principle/)

By transpilation from the `F#` source code using [Fable](https://fable.io/), it is not only hosted on `nuget`, but also available as a JavaScript package on `npm` and as a python package on `PyPI`.

Therefore you can use `ARCtrl` either as a `.NET`, `Python` or `JavaScript` developer! Yay ðŸŽ‰

By the way: not only the source code is being transpiled. 
Instead, all **1500** tests are being transpiled and run, too. 
This ensures an ever growing reliability of the tool-stack.

If you still encounter bugs, unintuitive behaviours or missing functionality, feel free to open an Issue on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARCtrl).
