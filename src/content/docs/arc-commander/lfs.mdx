By default, the ARC Commander tracks the following files via LFS:
  
  1. All files stored in an assay's `dataset` folder, and
  2. All files with a size larger than 150 MB.

The threshold of 150 MB can easily be adjusted using the ARC Commander. For instance, if you want to decrease it to 5 MB (i.e. 5000000 bytes), run

```bash
arc config set -g -n "general.gitlfsbytethreshold" -v "5000000"
```

:::tip
The LFS system is also the reason why [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) needs to be installed prior to using the ARC Commander.

#### Track files via LFS

In addition to the defaults, you can also actively choose, which files to track via LFS.

1. Update your local ARC via `arc sync`
2. Add large files or folders by copying or moving them to your ARC
3. Track files via

```bash
git lfs track "<path/to/FolderWithLargeFiles/**>"
git add .gitattributes
```

4. Sync your ARC to the DataHUB via `arc sync`


:::caution
Please avoid uploading large files without [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (i.e. accidentally with pure git, when git-lfs is not available).

#### Downloading an ARC without large data files

Sometimes you may want to download your ARC to a smaller computer, where you do not need a full copy of your ARC including all its large data files. For instance, you just want to work with smaller derived data sets or want to update ISA metadata. 
In this case, you can add the `-n` or `--nolfs` flag to your `arc get` command: 

```bash
arc get --nolfs -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUser>/<YourARC>
```

For example, have a look at the ARC https://git.nfdi4plants.org/shiltemann/physcomitrium-patens-light-signaling-2022/. 
In the DataHUB this ARC has a storage volume of ~84GB (December 2023), most of which comes from the [large RNASeq data files](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/shiltemann/physcomitrium-patens-light-signaling-2022/-/tree/main/assays/RNASeq/dataset) flagged as "LFS".

You can download this ARC without the LFS objects via

```bash
arc get --nolfs -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/shiltemann/physcomitrium-patens-light-signaling-2022/
```

#### Selectively download large files

If at some point you wish to selectively download one or more of the LFS objects of your ARC to that machine, you can do so via `git lfs pull --include "<path/to/fileOrFolder>"`

For example, the following command will download one of the large RNASeq data files.

```bash
git lfs pull --include "assays/RNASeq/dataset/R19/R19_1.fq.gz"
```

#### Download all large files in the ARC

If at some point you wish to download **all** LFS files of your ARC, you can use the following command

```bash
git lfs pull --include "*"
```
