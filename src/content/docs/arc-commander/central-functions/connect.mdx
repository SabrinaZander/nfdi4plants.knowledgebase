In case you have not yet connected your local repository to a remote one, you can specify the remote repository with the flag `--repositoryaddress` or `-r` in combination with a URL + ".git", e.g.,

```bash "-r"
arc sync -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>
```

:::tip
If your local repository is not connected to a remote repository, `arc sync` will only track and store changes locally. The ARC Commander will not synchronize  any changes to the DataHUB.
