The ARC Commander comes with a leveled help menu, that suggests suitable inputs on every level of command or subcommand. You can simply add `-h` or `--help` at the end of an ARC Commander action to display the respective help menu.

Some examples: 

```bash
arc --help
```

```bash
arc investigation --h
```

```bash
arc investigation create --help
```

```bash
arc study --h
```

```bash
arc study add --help
```

```bash
arc assay remove --help
```
