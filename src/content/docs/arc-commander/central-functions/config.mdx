Some users might want to use different signatures for different repositories, e.g., developing software on GitHub and working on ARCs on the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org). Besides your global git configuration, you can store the information you want to use for editing ARCs within the ARC Commander config:

```bash
arc config set -g -n "general.gitname" -v "Name of choice"
arc config set -g -n "general.gitemail" -v "Email of choice"
```

To transfer the information from the global ARC Commander config to the local git config of the ARC use

```bash
arc config setgituser
```

:::tip
This will automatically transfer the info stored globally in the ARC Commander config to the local git config of the ARC.
