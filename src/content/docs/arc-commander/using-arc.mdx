- For most steps in this manual and in the [ARC Commander QuickStart](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander/arc-commander-quick-start), it is assumed, that you opened a [shell or command prompt](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/fundamentals/tutorial-command-line) within a directory you want to initiate as an ARC
- In the shell, `arc` defines the path to the ARC Commander executable (e.g. on Windows "C:\Users\userA\programs\ArcCommander\arc.exe").
- Note that each input that contains non-literal characters must be encapsulated in "quotation marks" when entered within the shell. This also applies when using the editor for numerals that are no numbers (dates, phone numbers, etc.).

## Different Routes to add Metadata

Using the ARC commander, most metadata information (e.g. the title or identifier of your investigation) can theoretically be entered solely by using the shell.

For instance, the following command would create an investigation with the identifier `MyInv001` and title `My Investigation 001`:

```bash
arc investigation create --identifier "MyInv001" --title "My Investigation 001"
``` 

If no arguments are supplied, a text editor may pop up asking you for suitable metadata values. 
For instance, the command 

```bash
arc investigation create
```

will open a text editor and (amongst other metadata keys) allow you to enter


```yaml
Identifier:

#A concise name given to the investigation
Title:

#A textual description of the investigation
Description:
```

After entering the required values, you can save and close the editor.
