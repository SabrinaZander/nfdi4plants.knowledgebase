The [DataHUB](<https://git.nfdi4plants.org>) allows you to share your ARCs with registered lab or project partners. After [registration](<https://register.nfdi4plants.org>), you need to setup the ARC Commander for smooth ARC synchronization between your computer and the DataHUB.

:::tip
This needs to be done only once per computer.
:::

## Enable Git to store credentials on your computer

Open a command prompt or terminal and execute the following command(s)

### Windows / Linux

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

### MacOS

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

## Receive and store a DataHUB access token

```bash
arc remote accesstoken get -s https://git.nfdi4plants.org
```

A browser window will open asking for your DataPLANT login. After login you are asked to authorize your computer to communicate with the DataHUB.
In case you are already logged in, the browser will directly display a plain `Success` message to you.

This authenticates your computer to communicate with your personal DataHUB account

:::tip
After two hours you have to repeat this process as this token will expire. Have a look at the next section to learn how to create a longer lasting token (e.g. for large data uploads).

## Store a configurable DataHUB access token for your project

Access tokens created with the ARCommander expire after two hours. To create a longer-lasting access token for your project, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. 
    <details>
      <summary>Create a project access token</summary>

      <ProjectToken />

    </details>

2. Store the token in your local ARC

    ```bash
    arc remoteaccess accesstoken store --token <replaceWithYourToken>
    ```

</Steps>

Once set up, you will not need to authenticate yourself (e.g., by manually retrieving a token through 'arc remote token get') until the token expires. When switching to another machine you have to repeat the process.
