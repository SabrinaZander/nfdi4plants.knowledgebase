This guide introduces the **ARC Commander**, a command line tool to create, edit and share you ARC.
It requires some experience with the command line (command prompt, shell, terminal,...).

:::tip
Before following this guide, we recommend to explore the [Getting Started guide](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/) for a more comprehensive overview of ARC concepts and features. 

Here we reproduce parts of Viola's example ARC created there. However, the ARC Commander by design does not offer all functions you know from [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect/).
For metadata annotations you can either work on your ARC in ARCitect as explained in the [Getting Started guide](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/) or explore the different options of using [Swate](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/).

## Setup

Before using the ARC commander, please install Git, Git-LFS and ARC Commander and setup access to your DataHUB account.

<Steps>

  1. 
      <details>
        <summary>Install and setup Git and Git-LFS</summary>
        <InstallationGit />
      </details>
  
  2. 
      <details>
        <summary>Install ARC Commander</summary>
        <InstallationGit />
      </details>

  3. 
      <details>
        <summary>Register for a DataPLANT account</summary>
        <DataHUBAccount />
      </details>

  4.

        <Access />
      </details>
      

</Steps>


## Initialize your ARC

<Steps>

  1. Create and navigate to a local folder, which you want to initialize as an ARC, e.g. via file explorer or

      ```bash
      mkdir AthalianaColdStressSugar
      cd AthalianaColdStressSugar
      ```
  
  2. Initialize your ARC by executing

      ```bash
      arc init -i AthalianaColdStressSugar
      ```

      :::tip
      Avoid using spaces or special characters in the identifier.
      :::

</Steps>

:::tip
The ISA investigation (`-i` or `--investigation`) workbook allows you to record administrative metadata of your project.
The `isa.investigation.xlsx` workbook including an identifier to your ARC has been added to the project during initialization.
:::

This created the general ARC folder structure:

<NewARC />

## Adding investigation metadata

<Steps>
  
  1. Add a Title

      ```bash
      arc investigation --title "Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation"
      ```  
  
  2. Add a Description

      ```bash
      arc i --description "This experiment investigates the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to cold stress by subjecting plants to low-temperature conditions and monitoring physiological, molecular, and growth-related changes. Cold-treated plants are compared with control groups grown under optimal conditions to assess stress-related markers such as changes in protein abundance, sugar content, and growth rates. The goal is to identify key molecules and physiological responses involved in cold tolerance, contributing to the understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms."
      ```

  3. Add Contacts

      ```bash
      arc i person register -f Jasmine -l Beetroot
      arc i person register -f Oliver -l Sage
      arc i person register -f Viola -l Canina --email viola@plantscience.xyz
      ```

</Steps>


## Adding studies and assays

<Steps>

1. Add studies

    ```bash
    arc study add -s AthalianaColdStress
    ```
  
2. Add assays

    ```bash
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a SugarMeasurement
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a Proteomics_MS
    arc assay add -s AthalianaColdStress -a Proteomics_DataAnalysis
    ```

    :::note
    An assay must be linked to a study. If a study does not exist, it will be created automatically in this step.
    :::

</Steps>

The ARC Commander will add subdirectories to the *studies* and *assays* folders. Your ARC should
look similar to this now:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>
- studies
  - AthalianaColdStress
    - resources
    - protocols
    - **isa.study.xlsx**
  - ...
- assays
  - SugarMeasurement
    - dataset
    - protocols
    - **isa.assay.xlsx**
  - ...
- workflows
  - ...
- runs
  - ...
- isa.investigation.xlsx
</FileTree>


:::note
The ISA study (`-s`, `--study`) and ISA assay (`-a`, `--assay`) workbooks allow you to annotate your experimental data.

## Sharing your ARC

### ARC synchronization

1. Synchronize your ARCs with the DataHUB using the command

```bash
arc sync 
```

2. If you did not connect your local ARC with a remote one so far, you can specify the remote address with the flag `-r` followed by an URL, e.g.,

```bash
arc sync -r https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>
```

3. In case you want to create a new remote repository at this URL, it needs to be assembled as the following example: 
```bash
# https://git.nfdi4plants.org/<YourUserName>/<YourARC>
```

4. If no repository exists under the given URL, the ARC Commander will produce an error ensuring that you spelled the URL correctly. To force synchronization, use 

```bash
arc sync -f
```

5. Check if the upload was successful by visiting your ARC at the respective URL in your browser.

>Note: Alternatively, you can first create a new blank repository in the [DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org) by clicking "New project/repository" in the plus drop down menu of the navigation bar on top. Afterwards, you can sync your local ARC to the respective repository by adapting the URL to the newly generated one. 

### Setting a git user

Some users might want to use different signatures for different repositories, e.g. for developing software on GitHub and working on ARCs on [DataPLANT's DataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org). Besides your global git configuration, you can store the information you want to use for editing ARCs within the ARC Commander config:

```bash
arc config set -g -n "general.gitname" -v "Name of choice"
arc config set -g -n "general.gitemail" -v "Email of choice"
```
To transfer the information from the global ARC Commander config to the local git config of the ARC use

```bash
arc config setgituser
```

### Invite collaborators

You can invite lab-colleagues or project partners to join your ARC for collaboration. While inside your ARC on the DataHUB, click on *Project information -\> Members* in the left navigation panel. Search for registered researchers and select a role for each individually. These roles come along with different rights.  
Briefly:

- *Guests:* Have the least rights. They will not be able to see the content of your ARC (only the wiki page).
- *Reporters*: Have read access to your ARC. This is recommended for people you ask for consultancy.
- *Developers:* The choice for most people you want to invite to your ARC. Developers have read and write access, but cannot maintain the project on the DataHUB, e.g. inviting others.  
- *Maintainers:* Gives the person the same rights as you have (except of removing you from your own project). This is recommended for inviting PIs or group leaders allowing them to add their group members for data upload or analysis to the project as well.
