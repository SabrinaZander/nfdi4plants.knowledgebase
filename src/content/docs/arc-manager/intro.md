The ARCmanager is a web service that allows DataPLANT users to create and modify ARCs in a web browser environment. Edits done with the ARCmanager will be directly applied to the copy of your ARC on the respective DataHUB. You can access the web service with any browser by following this [link](https://nfdi4plants.de/arcmanager/app/index.html).

While the [ARC Commander](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander) provides a command line interface (CLI) to create and modify ARCs, and the [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect) is a desktop application to perform similar tasks with a graphical user interface (GUI), the ARCmanager provides a web interface for editing ARCs without the necessity to install any software on your computer.
