Before using [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect) (except for Windows) or [ARC Commander](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander), **Git** and **Git LFS** must be installed.

## Download and install Git and Git LFS

import GitDownload from 'git-download.mdx'

<GitDownload />

### Check your Git installation

import GitCheck from 'git-check.mdx'

<GitCheck />

## Configure Git User

Git always signs "commits" with a user `name` and `e-mail address`. These are then also used by the DataHUB to associate the commits to your user account.

To add your user name and email address to the git configuration on your computer, run the following two commands in a command prompt or terminal. Make sure to replace "Your DataHUB Name" and "Your DataHUB Email Address" with your information from the DataHUB.

1. Your name

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your DataHUB Name"
```

2. Your email address

```bash
git config --global user.email "Your DataHUB Email Address"
```

:::tip
Configuration needs to be done only once after installation of git on your system.
:::

### Check your Git configuration

Run this command to display your user configuration

```bash
git config --global --get-regexp user
```

## Enable Git to store credentials on your computer


import GitCredentials from './git-credentials.mdx'

<GitCredentials />
