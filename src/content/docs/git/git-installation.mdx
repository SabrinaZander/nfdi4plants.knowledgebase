Before using [ARC Commander](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arc-commander) or [ARCitect](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/arcitect) (except for Windows), Git and Git LFS must be installed.

## Download and install Git and Git LFS

import GitDownload from 'git-download.mdx'

<GitDownload />

## Initialize Git LFS

After installation of Git LFS you **must** run the following command once to make sure Git LFS is initialized on your system.

```bash
git lfs install
```

### Check your Git installation

To check, that Git and Git LFS are installed on your computer, open a **new** command prompt or terminal and execute the following two commands. These should display the installed version.

```bash
git --version
```

```bash
git-lfs --version
```

Recommended Git version â‰¥ 2.32.0

## Configure Git

Git always signs "commits" with a user `name` and `e-mail address`. These are then also used by the DataHUB to associate the commits to your user account.

To add your user name and email address to the git configuration on your computer, run the following two commands in a command prompt or terminal. Make sure to replace "Your DataHUB Name" and "Your DataHUB Email Address" with your information from the DataHUB.

1. Your name

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your DataHUB Name"
```

2. Your email address

```bash
git config --global user.email "Your DataHUB Email Address"
```

:::tip
Configuration needs to be done only once after installation of git on your system.

### Check your Git configuration

Run this command to display your user configuration

```bash
git config --global --get-regexp user
```
