Here we explain how to handle large data files in your ARC.

## Large File Storage (LFS)

ARCs and the DataHUB come with a mechanism to sync and store large files called *Large File Storage (LFS)*. LFS is an efficient way to store your large data files. These files are called "LFS objects". Rather than checking every file during every `arc sync` (ARC Commander) or DataHUB Sync (ARCitect), the tools first check *whether there was a change at all*. And only if this is the case, it scans *what* was changed. This way it saves time and computing power compared to always scanning all large files for possible changes.

## ARCitect

import ARCitectLFS from '../arcitect/arcitect-lfs.mdx'

<ARCitectLFS />

## ARC Commander

import ARCCommanderLFS from '../arc-commander/lfs.mdx'

<ARCCommanderLFS />


## DataHUB 

import DataHUBLFS from '../datahub/arc-files/datahub-lfs.mdx'

<DataHUBLFS />
