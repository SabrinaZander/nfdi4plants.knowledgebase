In this guide we show you how to keep files from syncing to the DataHUB. This can help to keep large intermediate, sensitive or unpublished data from uploading to the DataHUB.

## The .gitignore file

Every ARC can contain a special file called `.gitignore`, that typically resides in the root of the ARC. Files and folders listed in your ARC's `.gitignore` will be *ignored* by the ARC's version control system. That means changes to those files will not be tracked by ARC tools (e.g. ARC Commander or ARCitect) nor will the files be synced to the DataHUB.

:::tip
1. If `.gitignore` does not exist in your ARC, you can simply create it in your ARC's root using a text editor or the ARCitect.
2. By default, this file is hidden from your File Explorer ([Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11)) or Finder ([macOS](https://nordlocker.com/blog/how-to-show-hidden-files-mac/)).

:::caution
1. Since files added to `.gitignore` on one machine will not be synced to the DataHUB, they will also not be available on another machine, to where you sync your ARC.
2. If a file in your ARC was already synced to the DataHUB, adding it to `.gitignore` will only keep it from future syncs, it will however not remove the existing file.

## Adding .gitignore

You can create and add a new `.gitignore` file via any simple text editor or via ARCitect.
A default `.gitignore` that includes typical hidden system and temporary files can be <a href="/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/.gitignore">**downloaded here**</a>. 

## Adding files to .gitignore

<Steps>

1. Open your ARC in the ARCitect or in your File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (macOS)
2. Add a new file `my-personal-notes.txt` or folder `intermediate-results` to the ARC
3. Open `.gitignore` via ARCitect or a text editor.
   1. Add a new line `my-personal-notes.txt` or `intermediate-results/` at the end of the file
   2. Save and close the file.
4. Sync the ARC via ARC commander or ARCitect.
5. Check your ARC in the DataHUB, to see that the file `my-personal-notes.txt` or folder `intermediate-results/` does not exist there.

</Steps>

## Allowing files to sync

If at some point you want the *ignored* file or folder to sync, you can simply remove the respective line from your ARC's `.gitignore` file.
