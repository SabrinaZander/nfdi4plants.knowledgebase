Licenses are essential for defining how others can use, modify, and distribute the code or data within a project. When you create and share an ARC, a license provides the formal framework that protects the data creatorsâ€™ rights while clarifying the terms of use for the content.

In the DataHUB, a license is essentially a standardized text file. 
To add a `LICENSE` to your ARC

<Steps>

1. navigate to your ARC in the DataHUB,
2. click on "Add LICENSE" on the right sidebar menu(1),
3. use a provided license template or enter the license text.

:::tip
We recommend to use a CC-BY license, which is not offered as a template by DataHUB. For a CC-BY 4.0 license, you can copy the legal code from https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt.

:::note
Remember to sync your local ARC (via ARC Commander or ARCitect) after creating a `LICENSE` file in the DataHUB.
