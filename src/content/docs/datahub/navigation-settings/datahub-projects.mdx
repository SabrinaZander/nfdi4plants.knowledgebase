## Project = ARC

- In the DataHUB, ARCs are called "projects"; they are the same.
- An ARC can be shared with individual users (invited as "members") or a group.

:::note
"Projects" and ["Groups"](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub/working-together/datahub-groups) are not the same
:::

## Projects panel

The projects panel lists all ARCs you have access to.

<Steps>

1. Choose a tab (1) to see `Your` or `Starred` ARCs.
2. The main panel (2) lists all ARCs
3. Here you can also see, the visibility level (3), and
4. your permission or role (4) for the listed ARC.
5. `Explore` other publicly available ARCs and all of your private and public ARCs at once.
6. You can create a **New Project** in the top-right corner (5).

</Steps>

:::note
Once you click on one of the listed ARCs, you are directed to the [ARC panel](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/datahub/navigation-settings/datahub-arc-panel) of that ARC.

:::tip
Although the DataHUB offers to create a *New Project*, we recommend to use a dedicated software like ARCitect or ARC Commander to create an ARC.
