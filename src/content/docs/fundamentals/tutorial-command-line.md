Find the **command-line interface (CLI)** on your system.

- On Windows: Enter `cmd`  or `powershell` into the explorer path
- On MacOS: Search `terminal` via spotlight (&#8984; + &#9251;) or navigate to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal`

:::note
In our tutorials we sometimes use "shell", "powershell", "terminal", "command prompt", "command-line" or "command-line interface (CLI)" interchangeably. Although they are technically not the same, they usually serve the same purpose here.
