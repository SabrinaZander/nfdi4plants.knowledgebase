## What is a Docker Container?

A container is a standardised software unit that bundles program code and all necessary dependencies so that applications can run quickly and reliably in different IT environments. You can think of it as a box that includes everything needed for your project.

A Docker container image is a lightweight, self-contained, executable software package that contains everything necessary to run an application: the code, the runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and configurations. Using Docker containers can, for example, improve reproducibility, which is a significant advantage over non-isolated projects.

## What is a Dev Container?

A Dev Container is based on a container concept such as Docker. Docker is not strictly required for its execution, but a container engine that is compatible with the Dev Container standard is necessary, such as Docker, Podman, or a corresponding runtime environment.

:::tip[example]
Think of it like this: every Jacuzzi is a whirlpool, but not every whirlpool is a Jacuzzi. Likewise, every Dev Container is a Docker container, but not every Docker container is a Dev Container. They serve the same purpose and operate similarly. If you run the container using Docker, it’s a Docker container; otherwise, it’s just a Dev Container.

## Common Workflow Language

The Common Workflow Language (CWL) is explained in detail in the Knowledgebase and can be found [here](https://nfdi4plants.github.io/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/cwl/cwl-introduction/).

# Tutorial

## Setup

<Steps>

  1. Install VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  2. Install the Dev Containers extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
  3. Install other necessary extensions for your project (For example: .NET Install Tool or Ionide for F#)
  4. Install Docker Desktop [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

</Steps>


## Dev Container in VS Code
<Steps>
  
  1. Create a new folder with your project name and open it in VS Code.  
  2. In the VS Code menu bar, click **`View** > Command Palette`** and run the following command: **`Dev Containers: Add Dev Container Configuration Files...`**

</Steps>

## Settings

There are two options for setting up your environment:

### Option A
<Steps>

  1. Start with "Add configuration to workspace"  
  2. Choose **.NET (C#), Node.js (TypeScript) & MS SQL** 
  3. Select `8.0-bookworm` (default)  
  4. Select `-lts` (default)  
  5. Then press OK, or select additional features if desired

</Steps>

:::tip[Important]
If you choose this option, you must manually add the F# extension to the `devcontainer.json` file. Insert `"ms-dotnettools.fsharp"` in the `"extensions"` section.
:::

### Option B
<Steps>

  1. Start with "Add configuration to workspace" 
  2. Choose **F# (.NET)** and press OK

</Steps>

:::tip[Important]
If you choose this option, you’ll need to create your own Dockerfile!
:::

:::tip
You now have the files needed to run the Dev Container: `devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile`.  
- `devcontainer.json` tells VS Code how to work with that environment (extensions, settings, folder paths).  
- The `Dockerfile` is a text file with instructions to build a Docker image—it defines everything needed to set up and run your application in a container.
:::


<Card icon="pen" title="Example">

This example uses **Option B**, which requires creating a Dockerfile. You can create it by running the command `touch Dockerfile` in the VS Code terminal. The image below shows a simple Dockerfile:

```txt title="DockerFile"
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0

ENV DOTNET.DockerScoutOptOut=1

COPY *.devcontainer/settings.vscode.json /root/.vscode-remote/data/Machine/setting.json

RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install git procps 
```

**Note:** Check your .NET version using the terminal or PowerShell with `dotnet --version`.

Now we have everything we need to start our project.

# Start the Programming Journey

## Example

This tutorial starts with two scripts, each of which creates a column chart and a target folder to store the results. To better understand the file structure and the CWL workflow, the example with all files is available in an ARC. You can find it [here](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/mrspaulinehans/DevContainerAndCWL)

<Steps> 
1. Create your scripts 

      ```fsharp title="exampleChart1.fsx"
      //first example chart for creating a simple column chart, 
      //with Chart.saveHtml, where you can define the
      //location where the chart should be saved.

      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET, 5.0.0"
      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET.Interactive, 5.0.0"
      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET.ImageExport, 6.1.0"
      open Plotly.NET
      open Plotly.NET.Interactive
      open System 
      open System.IO 
      //example: simple column chart for Devcontainer Tutorial 
      let x = 25
      let y = 85
      let combine = [|x, y|]
      let buildChart = 
          Chart.Column (
              keysValues = combine,
              Name = "Example Chart for Devcontainer Tutorial"
          )
      buildChart |> Chart.saveHtml (String.concat "" [|"./devcontainerTutorial/runs/execution"; "/Results/exampleChart1"|])
      ```

2. The second example Script is identical 

      ```fsharp title="exampleChart2.fsx"
      //second example chart, which is identical to the one above
      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET, 5.0.0"
      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET.Interactive, 5.0.0"
      #r "nuget: Plotly.NET.ImageExport, 6.1.0"
      open Plotly.NET
      open Plotly.NET.Interactive
      open System 
      open System.IO
      //example Chart 2 for Devocontainer tutorial 
      let x = 34
      let y = 26 
      let combine = [| x, y|]
      let buildChart = 
          Chart.Column (
              keysValues = combine,
              Name = "Example Chart for Devcontainer Tutorial"
          )
      buildChart |> Chart.saveHtml (String.concat "" [|"./devcontainerTutorial/runs/execution"; "/Results/exampleChart2"|])
      ```
3. After that we need the CWL Command-Line-Tools that calls the scripts.

      ```cwl title="exampleChart1.cwl"
      cwlVersion: v1.2
      class: CommandLineTool
      hints:
        DockerRequirement:
          dockerImageId: "devcontainertutorial"
          dockerFile: {$include: "./Dockerfile"}
      requirements:
        - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
          listing:
            - entryname: devcontainerTutorial
              entry: $(inputs.devcontainerTutorial)
              writable: true
        - class: EnvVarRequirement
          envDef:
            - envName: DOTNET_NOLOGO
              envValue: "true"
        - class: NetworkAccess
          networkAccess: true
      baseCommand: [dotnet, fsi, "./devcontainerTutorial/workflows/exampleChart1.fsx"]
      inputs: 
        devcontainerTutorial:
          type: Directory
      outputs: 
        output_exampleChart1: 
          type: Directory
          outputBinding: 
            glob: ./devcontainerTutorial/runs/execution/Results
      ``` 
      This was for the Commnad-Line-Tool for first script (exampleChart1.fsx). Following is the second Command-Line-Tool for the second script (exampleChart2.fsx)
      ```cwl title="exampleChart2.cwl"
      cwlVersion: v1.2
      class: CommandLineTool
      hints:
        DockerRequirement:
          dockerImageId: "devcontainertutorial"
          dockerFile: {$include: "./Dockerfile"}
      requirements:
        - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
          listing:
            - entryname: devcontainerTutorial
              entry: $(inputs.devcontainerTutorial)
              writable: true
        - class: EnvVarRequirement
          envDef:
            - envName: DOTNET_NOLOGO
              envValue: "true"
        - class: NetworkAccess
          networkAccess: true
      baseCommand: [dotnet, fsi, "./devcontainerTutorial/workflows/exampleChart2.fsx"]
      inputs: 
        devcontainerTutorial:
          type: Directory
      outputs: 
        output_exampleChart2: 
          type: Directory
          outputBinding: 
            glob: ./devcontainerTutorial/runs/execution/Results
      ```

3. With the Command-Line-Tools we can create the CWL workflow, that calls the two Command-Line-Tools

      ```cwl title="mainWorkflow.cwl"
      cwlVersion: v1.2
      class: Workflow 
      hints: 
          DockerRequirement: 
            dockerImageId: "devcontainerTutorial"
            dockerFile: {$include: "./Dockerfile"}
      requirements: 
        - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
          listing: 
            - entryname: tutorialDevcontainer 
              entry: $(inputs.tutorialDevcontainer)
              writable: true 
        - class: MultipleInputFeatureRequirement 
      inputs: 
        devcontainerTutorial: Directory 
        folder: string 
      steps: 
        exampleChart1: 
          run: exampleChart1.cwl 
          in: 
            devcontainerTutorial: devcontainerTutorial
          out: [output_exampleChart1]
        exampleChart2: 
          run: exampleChart2.cwl 
          in: 
            devcontainerTutorial: devcontainerTutorial
          out: [output_exampleChart2]
        expressionTool: 
          run: exTool.cwl 
          in: 
            directory_array: [exampleChart1/output_exampleChart1, exampleChart2/output_exampleChart2]
            newname: folder
          out: [pool_directory]
      outputs: 
        outputMain:
          type: Directory
          outputSource: expressionTool/pool_directory
      ```
    The five scripts shown above are located in an ARC in the workflow directory. The next step is to create a **run.cwl** which is together with the **run.yml** located in the runs directory.

4. To follow the ARC specification we need to create a **run.cwl** in the runs directory, that is calling our main workflow. The files are then stored in the ARC as follows:
  
    <FileTree>
      - ...
      - workflows 
        - exampleChart1.fsx 
        - exampleChart2.fsx
        - exampleChart1.cwl  
        - exampleChart2.cwl 
        - workflow.cwl 
      - runs 
        - run.cwl
        - run.yml 
      - ...
    </FileTree>

    The **run.cwl** looks like this: 

      ```cwl title="run.cwl"
      cwlVersion: v1.2
      class: Workflow 
      hints: 
          DockerRequirement: 
            dockerImageId: "devcontainerTutorial"
            dockerFile: {$include: "./Dockerfile"}
      requirements: 
        - class: InitialWorkDirRequirement
          listing: 
            - entryname: tutorialDevcontainer 
              entry: $(inputs.tutorialDevcontainer)
              writable: true 
        - class: MultipleInputFeatureRequirement 
        - class: SubworkflowFeatureRequirement
      inputs: 
        devcontainerTutorial: Directory 
        folder: string 
      steps: 
        mainWorkflow: 
          run: ../../workflows/workflow.cwl 
          in: 
            devcontainerTutorial: devcontainerTutorial
            folder: folder 
          out: [outputMain]
      outputs: 
        outputMain: 
          type: Directory
          outputSource: mainWorkflow/outputMain
      ```
5. To finish our journey and to execute our CWL workflow we need the **run.yml** which is also located in the runs directory. 
    
      ```yaml title="run.yml" 
      devcontainerTutorial: 
          class: Directory 
          path: ../../
      folder: "Results" 
      ``` 
      :::tip 
      Additional information about the YAML file can be found [here](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/topics/yaml-guide.html) 
      :::

And now you have everything you need to run a CWL workflow within a Docker container. Just open your Powershell with WSL (or terminal, if you're using Linux) and run the following command: `cwltool ./workflow.cwl ./run.yml`.
