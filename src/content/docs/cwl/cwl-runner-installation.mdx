The recommended CWL runner is [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool), the reference implementation for the CWL standards.

:::tip
- Please explore the [cwltool docs](https://cwltool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for latest installation instructions.
- We also recommend to install a software container engine (e.g. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)).

The installation on Windows can be done following the guide [here](https://cwltool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#ms-windows-users).

<Steps>

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux from the Microsoft Store
 
    ![WSL](@images/guides/cwl/wsl.png)

2. Install Debian from the Microsoft Store

    ![Debian](@images/guides/cwl/debian.png)

3. Set Debian as your default WSL 2 distro:
    - Open Windows PowerShell
    - Type `wsl --set-default debian` and hit enter
4. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
   - Start Docker Desktop and Navigate to Settings
   - Select "Use WSL 2 based engine" in the general tab and apply
      ![Docker WSL2](@images/guides/cwl/docker-wsl2.png)
   - Select "Enable Integration with my default distro" in the resources tab under WSL Integration
      ![Docker WSL Integration](@images/guides/cwl/docker-wsl-integration.png)
5. Start WSL:
    - Open Windows PowerShell
    - Type `wsl` and hit enter
    - You may need to specify a username and password if this is your first time using WSL (the password doesn't show when typing, just type and hit enter)
6. Follow the Instructions for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) in this tutorial

For installation on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): 
 
<Steps>

1. Run `sudo apt-get update` in the console
2. Install Python 3 if it is not already installed by executing the command `sudo apt install python3`
3. Install python virtual environment with `sudo apt install python3.11-venv`
    - You may need to change the version of python, depending on your installation
    - You can check the installed version with `python3 --version`
4. Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
    - The environment is named env here, the name can vary
5. Activate the virtual environment with `source env/bin/activate`
    - If you want to activate the environment from a different location, you must enter the full path to the installation location
        - e.g. if you installed it in your home directory, you would use `source /home/username/env/bin/activate`
6. Install the cwltool with pip by running `pip install cwltool`

## cwltool usage
 
- If you are on Windows, start the WSL
- Activate the virtual environment `source env/bin/activate`
    - If you want to activate the environment from a different location, you must enter the full path to the installation location
        - e.g. if you installed it in your home directory, you would use `source /home/username/env/bin/activate`
- Run `cwltool` by specifying the CWL `Workflow` or `CommandLineTool` description file path and the (optional) inputs file path (you can use relative or full paths): 
```bash
cwltool path/to/cwlfile.cwl path/to/jobfile.yml
```
- If you are in an ARC, you can navigate to the runs folder and type `wsl` in the address line to start the WSL at that location and execute a typical run after activating the virtual environment (see second step) with the command:
```bash
cwltool ./myRun/run.cwl ./myRun/run.yml
```
- CWL copies the relevant files to temporary directories located on the disc where your WSL is installed. If you want them on a different disk for perfomrance/size reasons, you can use the `--tmpdir-prefix` and `--tmp-outdir-prefix` options to specify the location of the temporary directories:
```bash
cwltool --tmp-outdir-prefix=/mnt/c/Users/myUser/Tempdir/ --tmpdir-prefix=/mnt/c/Users/myUser/Tempdir/ ./myRun/run.cwl ./myRun/run.yml
```

### Minimal example

Here is a very simplified example to check, that your cwltool installation functions

<Steps>

1. Store the following as `echo-tool.cwl`
    
    ```yaml
    #!/usr/bin/env cwl-runner

    cwlVersion: v1.2

    class: CommandLineTool

    baseCommand: [echo]

    stdout: message.txt

    inputs:
      message:
        type: string
        inputBinding:
          position: 1

    outputs:
      output:
        type: stdout
    ```

2. In the same folder, store the following as `job.yml`

    ```yaml
    message: "I love ARCs and CWL"
    ```

3. Now you can execute the tool
   - providing an `input` directly via CLI:  
   
   ```
   cwltool echo-tool.cwl --message "ARCs are great"
   ```
   or
   
   - providing the `input` via the `job.yml`:  
   
   ```
   cwltool echo-tool.cwl job.yml
   ```

4. Both create an `output` file called `message.txt` with your specified message.

</Steps>
