Do you find yourself describing the same workflows over and over again?  
You can save time by reusing them! Swateâ€™s Export/Import functionality allows you to store and reload completed Swate tables.

We recommend using the ARCtrl export format. Make sure to also select the ARCtrl format during import to ensure correct structure and compatibility.

<Json />

Save the file to a location accessible to you or your team (e.g., a shared folder or version-controlled repository).

This feature makes it easy to manage personal or group-specific metadata templates, ensuring consistency and efficiency across experiments and projects.
