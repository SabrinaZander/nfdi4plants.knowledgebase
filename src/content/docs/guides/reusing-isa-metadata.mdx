Do you find yourself describing the same workflows over and over again?
You can save time by reusing them! Swateâ€™s Export/Import functionality allows you to store and reload completed ISA Swate tables, including multiple filled-out sheets.

This feature is especially useful when working with recurring Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). You can export a fully filled-out set of metadata sheets once and later import it. This way, you only need to make minimal adjustments, such as adding new sample IDs, without having to re-enter all the metadata from scratch.

We recommend using the ARCtrl export format. Make sure to also select the ARCtrl format during import to ensure correct structure and compatibility.

<Json />

Save the file to a location accessible to you or your team (e.g., a shared folder or version-controlled repository). This makes it easy to manage personal or group-specific metadata tables, ensuring consistency and efficiency across experiments and projects.

A step-by-step guide including example data can be found in the [Viola Guide](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/start-here/sops).
