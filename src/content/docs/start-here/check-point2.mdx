✔︎ I've added measurement data as an assay  
✔︎ I've uploaded my ARC to the DataHUB to have a version-controlled save copy.  
✔︎ I've shared the ARC with colleagues, so they can explore my findings and contribute.   
</ViolaSays>

The ARC now looks like this:

import ViolasARC2 from '@components/mdx/ViolasARC-checkpoint2.mdx'

<ViolasARC2 />
