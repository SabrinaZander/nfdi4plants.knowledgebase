<ViolaSays>
Now so far I've just added the raw data. How can I describe how I analyzed my data and created results?

The ARC offers different options to annotate and perform data analysis.

## A computational workflow is like a protocol

Just like laboratory workflows produce samples or data, computational workflows produce data. They represent the processing steps used in data analysis or data transformation.

## Option I: Create a virtual assay

A computational workflow can simply be treated as a protocol. This can be a summary of the steps followed in any data analysis software. Or it can be a script.
Hence the data analysis can simply be packaged as an assay, with the computational workflow stored in `protocols` and the resulting data stored in `dataset`

    <Steps>

    1. Add a new assay `Visualization`. 
    2. Import the python script `heatmap.py` into `protocols`.
    3. Import the figure `heatmap.svg` resulting from the script into `dataset`.

        <FileTree>
        - assays
            - **Visualization**
                - dataset
                    - **heatmap.svg**
                - protocols
                    - **heatmap.py**
                - isa.assay.xlsx
                - README.md
        - ...
        </FileTree>

    4. Add a new annotation table to `Visualization`.
    5. Add the following building blocks:
        - `Input [Data]`: Use File Picker to reference the proteomics output file.
        - `Protocol REF`: Use File Picker to reference python script.
        - `Output [Data]`: Use File Picker to reference to heatmap result file.
    
        `Input [Data]`	 | `ProtocolREF` |  `Output [Data]` 
        ---------------- | -----------   | -------------- 
        sugar_result.csv | heatmap.py    | heatmap.svg

    </Steps>

## Option II: Create a run and a workflow

If your data analysis is code-based, you likely aim to make it reusable and actionable in-place. To achieve this, we recommend to wrap and annotate your workflow using [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/cwl). Although CWL is out of the scope of this starters' guide, we want to share the basic concept here.

- In the ARC the computational workflow is placed in the `workflows` folder.
- The results produced from workflows are stored in `runs`. Every time a workflow is employed, it creates a new run result.

### CWL abstract â€“ documents to describe your computational workflows

The script file in `workflows` is accompanied with a CWL file, which contains workflow metadata to render it reusable. The specific parameters of a `run`'s execution are stored in a separate job file.
