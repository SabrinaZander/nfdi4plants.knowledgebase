✔︎ I've added experimental details from SOPs   
✔︎ In addition to the raw data, my ARC now contains the annotated data analysis.  
✔︎ Using a datamap I could point to the content of my result files
</ViolaSays>

The ARC now looks like this:

import ViolasARC3 from '@components/mdx/ViolasARC-checkpoint3.mdx'

<ViolasARC3 />
