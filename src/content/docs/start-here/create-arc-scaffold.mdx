So, where do I start? What is an ARC? And how do I create one?

</ViolaSays>

An ARC represents an entire investigation. At the top level, it includes directories named ‚Äústudies,‚Äù ‚Äúassays,‚Äù ‚Äúworkflows,‚Äù and ‚Äúruns,‚Äù along with an investigation metadata table that holds all administrative metadata.

It follows a very specific structure to be easily readable by machines ü§ñ. While it can be created by hand it is faster to use some tooling!

## ARCitect installation

The easiest way to create a new ARC is via **ARCitect**. 

<Card title="ARCitect installation" icon="setting">

If ARCitect is not yet installed on your computer, 

<details>
<summary>please follow these instructions to install ARCitect</summary>

import ARCitectInstallation from '../arcitect/installation.mdx'

<ARCitectInstallation />

</details>

## Create a new ARC

<Card icon="pen" title="ARCitect">
<Steps>

1. Start the **ARCitect** app.
2. In the sidebar on the left, click on `New ARC`.
3. Select a location and name for your ARC.

    <ViolaSays>

    To keep it simple, I call my ARC "AthalianaColdStressSugar"

    </ViolaSays>

    :::tip
    - Use a short acronym  
    - Avoid spaces and special characters in your ARC's name
    - Avoid administrative metadata (name, data, etc.)
    - Use a combination of keywords maybe grant number
    :::

4. ARCitect creates the base ARC folder on your computer and opens it right away.
  
    <FileTree>
    - AthalianaColdStressSugar
      - **studies**
      - **assays**
      - **workflows**
      - **runs**
      - isa.investigation.xlsx
    </FileTree>

    :::note
    The `isa.investigation.xlsx` is not displayed inside ARCitect, but can be accessed by clicking on "AthalianaColdStressSugar" (in Viola's example).
    :::

</Steps>
</Card>

<Card title="Your ARC's name" icon="approve-check" >

By default, your ARC's name will be used:

1. For the **ARC folder** on your computer.
2. As the **investigation identifier**.
