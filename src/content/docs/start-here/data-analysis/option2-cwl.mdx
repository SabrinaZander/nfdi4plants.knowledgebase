## Create a run and a workflow

If your data analysis is code-based, you likely aim to make it reusable and actionable in-place. To achieve this, we recommend to wrap and annotate your workflow using [Common Workflow Language (CWL)](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/cwl). Although CWL is out of the scope of this starters' guide, we want to share the basic concept here.

- In the ARC the computational workflow is placed in the `workflows` folder.
- The results produced from workflows are stored in `runs`. Every time a workflow is employed, it creates a new run result.

### CWL abstract – documents to describe your computational workflows

The script file in `workflows` is accompanied with a CWL file, which contains workflow metadata to render it reusable. The specific parameters of a `run`'s execution are stored in a separate job file.
