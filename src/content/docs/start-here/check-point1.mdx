<ViolaSays>
Done! I've created an ARC for my project! ðŸ¥³  
âœ”ï¸Ž I've added data and described the processes between green house and dataset.   
âœ”ï¸Ž I've uploaded my ARC to the DataHUB to have a version-controlled save copy.  
âœ”ï¸Ž I've shared the ARC with colleagues, so they can explore my findings and contribute.
