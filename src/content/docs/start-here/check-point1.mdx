import ViolaSays from '@components/ViolaSays.astro'
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<ViolaSays>
Done!   
  ✔︎ I've created an ARC for my project!  
  ✔︎ I've added metadata about the overall investigation  
  ✔︎ I've added a study for my samples  
</ViolaSays>

The ARC now looks like this:

import ViolasARC1 from '@components/mdx/ViolasARC-checkpoint1.mdx'

<ViolasARC1 />

The ARC is now ready to be filled with more life.
Explore the next sections to add an assay and share your ARC via the DataHUB.
