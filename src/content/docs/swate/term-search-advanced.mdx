Advanced term search is accessible on multiple occasions, but is functionally the same.

## How to use

### Term name keywords

Uses Apache Lucene query parser syntax on the term names.

### Term definition keywords

Uses Apache Lucene query parser syntax on the term definitions.

### Keep obsolete terms

To show obsolete terms in search results or not.

### Apache Lucene query parser syntax

You can find in depth information on this topic on the source documentation from [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).

Common use cases might include:

#### Simple Search

```txt title="Example"
instrument model
```

Specifies that the result MUST contain `instrument` OR `model`.

#### Must include (+)

```txt title="Example" "+"
+instrument model
```

Using the `+` operator specifies that the result MUST contain `instrument` and MAY contain `model`

#### Must not include (-)

```txt title="Example" "-" "NOT"
instrument model NOT SCIEX

instrument model -SCIEX
```

Using the `-`/`NOT` operator specifies that the result MUST contain `instrument` OR `model` and MUST NOT contain `SCIEX`.

#### Grouping (" ")

```txt title="Example" '"'
"instrument model"
```

Using `""` grouping syntax specifies that the result MUST contain `instrument model`.
