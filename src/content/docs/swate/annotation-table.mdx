## Add an annotation table

In the "New Table" sheet, you can create your annotation table by adding [building blocks](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/building-blocks). 
Your annotation table should consist of an "Input", multiple descriptive building blocks ("Characteristics", "Parameters", "Components") and an "Output".

To create an annotation table within ARCitect, add a new table to your assay or study by clicking the plus (+) symbol next to your metadata sheet. 
Here, you can build your annotation table by adding [building blocks](/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/swate/building-blocks) the same way as in the Swate standalone.

## Add an annotation table

When you have an empty excel sheet or one hat already contains an annotation table, you can click on the "Create Annotation Table" icon of the navbar of the sidebar.
When the excel sheet contains no annotation table, a new annotation table will be created in the active excel sheet.
When an annotation table already exists in the active excel sheet, a new excel sheet will be created, become active and a new annotation table will be created in that sheet.

The new annotation table will be created in the cell that was selected, when you the "Create Annotation Table" icon was clicked.
The newly created annotation table has a size of 1 Input [Source Name] column and row.
